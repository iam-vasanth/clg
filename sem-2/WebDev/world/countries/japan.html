      <p>
        Japan is an island nation in East Asia consisting of four main islands
        and thousands of smaller ones. Known for harmoniously blending ancient
        traditions with modern innovation, Japan is a global leader in
        technology, automotive manufacturing, and robotics. The country has a
        rich cultural heritage including tea ceremonies, martial arts, and
        traditional arts like calligraphy and origami. Tokyo, its capital, is
        one of the world's most populous metropolitan areas and a hub of
        fashion, technology, and cuisine. Japan is famous for its cherry
        blossoms, Mount Fuji, bullet trains, anime and manga culture, and its
        exquisite cuisine including sushi and ramen. Despite limited natural
        resources, Japan has developed into the world's third-largest economy
        through innovation and manufacturing excellence.
