      <h1>Brazil</h1>
      <p>
        Brazil is the largest country in South America and the fifth-largest in
        the world by both area and population. It is home to the Amazon
        rainforest, the world's largest tropical rainforest, which plays a
        crucial role in global climate regulation. Brazil is known for its
        vibrant culture, including samba music, carnival celebrations, and
        football (soccer) passion. The country's diverse population reflects a
        rich mix of indigenous, European, African, and Asian heritage. Major
        cities include São Paulo, a bustling economic center, and Rio de
        Janeiro, famous for its beaches like Copacabana and landmarks like
        Christ the Redeemer. Brazil is a major agricultural exporter and has
        significant natural resources. Portuguese is the official language,
        making it the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas.
