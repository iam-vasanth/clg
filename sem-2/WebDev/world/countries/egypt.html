      <p>
        Egypt, officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental
        country spanning northeastern Africa and southwestern Asia. It is home
        to one of the world's oldest civilizations, with a history stretching
        back over 5,000 years. Egypt is famous for its ancient monuments,
        including the Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, and the temples of Luxor and
        Karnak. The Nile River, the longest river in the world, has been the
        lifeblood of Egyptian civilization for millennia. Modern Egypt's
        capital, Cairo, is one of Africa's largest cities and a cultural hub of
        the Arab world. The country is strategically important due to the Suez
        Canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. Egypt's rich
        Islamic heritage, Coptic Christian history, and archaeological treasures
        continue to fascinate scholars and tourists from around the globe.
