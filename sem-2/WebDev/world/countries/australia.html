      <p>
        Australia is both a country and a continent, located in the Southern
        Hemisphere between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is the world's
        sixth-largest country by total area and is known for its unique
        wildlife, including kangaroos, koalas, and platypuses found nowhere else
        on Earth. Australia's landscape is diverse, featuring the iconic
        Outback, the Great Barrier Reef (the world's largest coral reef system),
        pristine beaches, and modern cosmopolitan cities. The country has a
        strong economy based on natural resources, agriculture, and services.
        Major cities include Sydney, known for its Opera House and Harbour
        Bridge, Melbourne with its cultural scene, and Canberra, the capital.
        Australia has a rich Indigenous heritage dating back over 65,000 years,
        making Aboriginal Australians one of the world's oldest continuous
        cultures. The country is also known for its outdoor lifestyle, sports
        culture, and high quality of life.
