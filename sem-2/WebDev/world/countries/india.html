      <h1>India</h1>
      <p>
        India, officially the Republic of India, is a vast South Asian country
        with a rich and diverse cultural heritage spanning over 5,000 years. As
        the world's largest democracy and most populous nation, India is home to
        more than 1.4 billion people representing thousands of ethnic groups,
        languages, and religious traditions. The country's name derives from the
        Indus River, one of the major river systems that has sustained
        civilizations in the region for millennia.
